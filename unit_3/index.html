		<hr>

		 time to warp!</h1>

		<h3>TimeWarp is a utility app for shrinking distances and mastering time differences</h3>

		<p><b>WHAT</b>: As part of GA's UX class, I interviewed seven people on the topic of real-time communication across time zones. One common pain point emerged - the timing of calls.</p>

		<p><b>WHY</b>: Calculating the time difference becomes cumbersome when there are multiple time zones to keep in mind, when people travel and when there's no readily available Internet connection.</p>

		<p><b>HOW</b>: TimeWarp app seeks to eliminate those problems by allowing users to quickly figure out the local time of their conversation partners, find out the best time to call them and set call reminders.</p>

		<div id="list">

		<h4>Features</h4>

			<ul>
				
				<li>quickly check local time in other time zones</li>

				<li>find best time to call for ALL conversation partners</li>

				<li>set reminders for appropriate time to call</li>

				<li>geolocation, of course</li>

				<li>but also works without Internet connection</li>

			</ul>
